## Mail

Subject: HappyFood App description!

Dear Ms./Mr.,

I am writing to you to describe the new app we are about to release.

The app is called **"HappyFood"** and it is a health tracking food diary app.

### The Features

HappyFood is a food diary app that allows you to track your daily food intake.

While many other apps are available on the market, HappyFood is unique in that
it promotes **social interaction between users**.

This is done by allowing users to share their food diaries with their friends
and family. **It's made easy**!

In addition to that, users of HappyFood also publish recepies and tips on how to
eat healthy.

A ranking system with stars is avaliable for each recepie, so that users can
easily find the best recepies.

To promote social interaction, connections and avoid dispersion, HappyFood will
take consideration of a user's location and suggest recepies that are popular in
the area.

This to conform to the local culture and taste so that we don't end up with
Napoli users being feeded with american hawaiaan pizza recepies.

Many more features and details are available on our website. We will also get
deeper into the details during our next planned meeting.

### The Pros

The purpose of HappyFood is changing the way people see food and health.

Using the power of socials and internet, we want the users to experience the
same positive feeling (when posting a good recognized recepie, meal) a good
upvoted post on any social gives.

This should, in turn, encourage users to eat healthy and share their experience
with their friends.

The pros of a local community with a common goal are many. We believe that
HappyFood will be a success.

### Possible Applications

HappyFood can be used by different target users. While the main target is
private users (people who want to track their food intake inside a community),
HappyFood can also be used by others.

The focus on ease of use and accessibility, together with providing a different
UI for the main target groups, makes HappyFood a good candidate for many
applications, of which some are:

- **Schools**: HappyFood can be used by schools to teach children the importance
  of eating healthy. The social aspect of the app will encourage children to
  share their experience with their friends and family.

- **Hospitals and Nutritionists**: HappyFood can be used by professionals to
  track the food intake of their patients. This will allow doctors to better
  understand the patient's health and suggest the best diet.

- **Private users**: HappyFood can be used by private users to track their daily
  food intake and share their experience with their friends and family
  incentivazing each other to eat healthy.
