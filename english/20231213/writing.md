Which was in your opinion the greatest invention of all time? Why?

Describe both invention and reason (approx. 140-190 words)

## answer

The Internet: a global network of billions of computers and other electronic
devices.

Internet is what allowed machines to communicate with each other around the
world and by that, the people.

The way the world is shaped nowaday is because of the internet. It has changed
the way we communicate, the way we work, the way we learn, the way we live.

Wherever you are, you can probably find devices that are depending on network
access.

In this same room, I had to use google drive to access the document with the
instructions for this exam.

Computers and engines are great inventions too, but they are not as great.

Computers without internet are just a tool, a calculator.

Engines on their own revolutionized the world aswell. People going on holidays,
moving goods to reach harder to access places. Moving heavier goods. But without
internet, it wouldn't be as expanded as today.

We just need to think about the automation of orders, the tracking of goods, the
communication between companies that drive the trucks around for example.

Or maybe google maps, a service so easy to use on the phone that would not be
possible without internet and which eased immensely the way people travel around
the world.

There are so many other aspects I could speak of which improved our lives that I
couldn't fit all in this text.
