# methods and classes

## ex 1

create a method to calc the avg of a n int32 list and returns a double(avg) (
can write methods inside another method and it's scoped )

```csharp
Here are some of the most commonly used array methods in C#, along with whether they mutate the original array:

Array.Sort(): Sorts the elements in an entire one-dimensional Array. This method changes (mutates) the original array.

Array.Reverse(): Reverses the sequence of the elements in the entire one-dimensional Array. This method changes (mutates) the original array.

Array.Resize(): Changes the number of elements of a one-dimensional array to the specified new size. This method changes (mutates) the original array.

Array.IndexOf(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in a one-dimensional Array. This method does not mutate the original array.

Array.Clear(): Sets a range of elements in the Array to zero, to false, or to null, depending on the element type. This method changes (mutates) the original array.

Array.Copy(): Copies elements from an Array into another Array. This method does not mutate the original array.

Array.Find(): Searches for an element that matches the conditions defined by the specified predicate, and returns the first occurrence within the entire Array. This method does not mutate the original array.

Array.Exists(): Determines whether the Array contains elements that match the conditions defined by the specified predicate. This method does not mutate the original array.

Array.ForEach(): Performs the specified action on each element of the specified array. This method does not mutate the original array unless the action performed changes the array elements.

Array.BinarySearch(): Searches a one-dimensional sorted Array for a value, using a binary search algorithm. This method does not mutate the original array.
