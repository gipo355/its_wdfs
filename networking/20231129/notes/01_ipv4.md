## ethernet nic

24 bits on th OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)

second 24 bits are the vendor's serial number, assigned by the vendor

switch can work without IP

## why we use ip

# ipv4

32 bit 4 groups

0-255

0/24 = 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255 because 24 bits are used for the network address
and 8 for the host address

# classi IP

- class a: subnet 255.0.0.0/8
- class b: subnet 255.255.0.0/16
- class c: subnet 255.255.255.0/24

## broadcast address

all host with broadcast address will receive the message

## first byte range determines the class
